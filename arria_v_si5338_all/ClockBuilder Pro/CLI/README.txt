ClockBuilder Pro Command Line Interface (CLI) README

The CBPro CLI provides tools to create in-system programming 
and support files for a variety of use cases.

The DOS batch files in the Samples folder assume that the CBPro 
Bin folder is in your PATH. For example, C:\Program Files (x86)\
Silicon Laboratories\ClockBuilder Pro\Bin. The CBPro installer
has an option to add this to your PATH. If you find that it
is not, re-run the CBPro installer and check the box "Add application 
direcory to your system path to support command line tools" on
the Additional Tasks page of the installer wizard.

Each CLI has a built-in user manual that is available by
passing --help on the command line. For example:

   CBProDeviceRead --help

A copy of these is also in the Command-Help folder.

The following documents, in the Docs folder one level up, 
are also available:
