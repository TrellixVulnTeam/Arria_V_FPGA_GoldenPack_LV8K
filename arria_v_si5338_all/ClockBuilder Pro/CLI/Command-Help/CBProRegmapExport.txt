    CBProRegmapExport

SYNOPSIS

    CBProRegmapExport [ opts ] --project project-filename

    CBProRegmapExport --help

DESCRIPTION

    This tool exports meta-data about all of the customer facing settings and
    registers for a particular revision of a device. This is referred to as a
    register map aka regmap. Two types of exports are created: regmap tables
    and regmap C code files. Both are created in the folder you select.

    Three table versions are saved: CSV data, text report, and HTML report.
    For each setting, the following are defined:

    + Setting name (PN_BASE, N0_NUM, etc).
    + Register start address, bit offset within start address, and length.
    + NVM classification: not NVM backend (None), stored in user burnable NVM
    (User), or stored in protected factory programmed NVM (SiLab).
    + Setting type: read-only (R/O), read-write (R/W), or self-clearing (S/C).

    The C code is a header (.h) file containing a struct typedef and array of
    settings meta-data.
