SYNOPSIS

    CBProMultiEditAndExport [ opts ] --project base.slabtimeproj 
                            edits1.txt [ edits2.txt ... ]

    CBProMultiEditAndExport --help

DESCRIPTION

    Combines the features of CBProProjectEdit and CBProMultiProjectExport into
    a single tool:

       - You define a base project file
       - You define alternate clock configurations in the form of simple
         text file(s)
       - You run this tool to create new (edited) project files and export
         files for both the base project file and created project files

    Clock frequencies and state can be defined in the edit files. On supported
    devices, DSPLL bandwidth and assignment can also be defined. Editing is
    done via a simple text configuration file you specify on the command line.

    See IN-SYSTEM PROGRAMMING WORKFLOW section for recommended ways for a host
    microprocessor to use these exports to switch between configurations
    in-system.

EXAMPLE

    CBProMultiEditAndExport --out-folder Output --create-out-folder
                             --project Si5345-Base-Project.slabtimeproj
                             Si5345-Edits1.txt Si5345-Edits2.txt


        Output files are placed in the folder named Output, creating it if
        necessary. Two edit files are applied to the base project file,
        resulting in three sets of projects/exports labeled P1
        (Si5345-Base-Project.slabtimeproj), P2 (base+Si5345-Edits1.txt), and
        P3 (base+Si5345-Edits2.txt).

        The base project gets resaved as P1-Project.slabtimeproj, with
        frequency plan recalculated with latest algorithms.
        P2-Project.slabtimeproj and P3-Project.slabtimeproj with the edits are
        created.

        Design reports (P*-Report.txt), register write scripts
        (P*-Registers-Script.txt), and setting/bitfield dumps
        (P*-Settings.txt) are created for each project.

        Multi-project export files are created for P1-P3. Registers.csv
        contains register values for all projects and Settings.csv contains
        all setting/bitfield values.

        This example is available in
        Multi-Edit-And-Export-For-Single-PLL-Device within the C:\Program
        Files (x86)\Silicon Laboratories\ClockBuilder Pro\CLI\Samples folder.
        A second example for a multi-PLL Si5347 is in the
        Multi-Edit-And-Export-For-Multi-PLL-Device Samples folder.

EDIT FILE

    You must specify at least one edit file on the command line. This file
    will define what changes you want to make to one or more clock inputs
    and/outputs, as well as bandwidth on supported devices. The format of the
    file varies depending on whether the device in your project file has a
    single or multiple DSPLLs.

    If a single DSPLL device:

    Clock,State,Frequency
    IN0,Enabled,19.44 MHz
    IN1,Unused
    OUT0,Enabled,25*(825/128)M
    OUT1,Disabled,625M
    OUT5,Unused

    The header (Clock,State,Frequency) is required. Comments via lines
    starting with # are allowed, as are blank lines. Inputs can have one of
    two states: Enabled or Unused. Outputs have three possible states:
    Enabled, Disabled, or Unused. You **do not** have to list every input or
    output clock: any not listed will retain the setting in the project file.

    If a multiple DSPLL device:

    Clock,State,DSPLL,Frequency
    IN0,Enabled,ABCD,19.44 MHz
    IN1,Unused
    OUT0,Enabled,A,25*(825/128)M
    OUT1,Enabled,B,625M
    OUT5,Unused

    This adds a column for DSPLL assignment to the format. Note that in the
    case of an input, you list all DSPLLs that the input will feed.

    On select devices, DSPLL bandwidth can also be changed by specifying OLBW
    (nominal), FLBW (fastlock), or HOBW (holdover exit) as a clock name.
    Example for single DSPLL device:

    OLBW,,100 Hz
    FLBW,,1k

    Example for multi-DSPLL device:

    OLBW,,A,100
    FLBW,,A,1k
    OLBW,,B,200
    FLBW,,B,2k

    You can also specify bandwidth for multiple DSPLLs at once:

    OLBW,,AB,100 Hz
    FLBW,,AB,1 kHz

EXPORT FILES

    Registers.csv
    -------------

    Configurtion register values for each project file. Example:

    Address,Varies,P1,P2,P3
    ...
    0x043D,Yes,0x12,0x12,0x0A
    0x043E,No,0x06,0x06,0x06
    0x0442,No,0x00,0x00,
    0x0443,No,0x00,0x00,
    0x0444,No,0x00,0x00,
    ...

    The first column, labeled Address, is the two byte hex encoded register
    address. The second column, labeled Varies, indicates whether the current
    register has the same value for all projects included in the export (No)
    or at least two projects differ in value (Yes). Columns three onward
    contain the single byte register value for each project. Projects get
    labeled P1 onward using the order that projects were specified in the
    command line.

    If a register is not written (not defined and a don't care) by one project
    but is defined by another, the value cell will be empty for the project(s)
    that do not define the register. These empty cells will not count towards
    the Varies computation. For example, in the 0x0442-0x0444 example above
    project 3 does not define the register so the value is empty. Project 1
    and 2 have the same value. So Varies is No and this register need not be
    written when switching from one configuration to another.

    Settings.csv
    ------------

    This breaks out registers by setting (aka bitfield). Example:
             
    Location,Setting,Varies,P1,P2,P3
    ...
    0x043D[4:0],HSW_COARSE_PM_LEN_PLLA,Yes,0x12,0x12,0xA
    0x043E[4:0],HSW_COARSE_PM_DLY_PLLA,No,0x6,0x6,0x6
    0x0442[17:0],SLAB_OLA_FINE_ADJ_OVR,No,0x0,0x0,
    ...

    The first column, labeled Location, is the register(s) location of the
    setting. The next column, Setting, identifies the setting by name. Similar
    to Registers.csv, there is a Varies column that indicates whether the
    current setting has the same value for all projects included in the export
    (No) or at least two projects differ in value (Yes). Successive columns
    contain the hexadecimal setting values for each project. Settings may be
    1-bit to 64-bits wide. The named settings are converted to individual
    single byte register values by this tool, to greatly simplify and speed up
    programming.

    If a setting is not written (not defined and a don't care) by one project
    but is defined by another, the value cell will be empty for the project(s)
    that do not define the setting. These empty cells will not count towards
    the Varies computation. For example, in the example above project 3 does
    not define a value for SLAB_OLA_FINE_ADJ_OVR above, so the value is empty.
    Project 1 and 2 have the same value. So Varies is No and this setting need
    not be written when switching from one configuration to another.

    Note any control register writes necessary to fully load new frequency
    plan are **NOT** included in the Registers.csv and Settings.csv exports.

    P*-Report.txt
    -------------

    A design report is also created for each project file, and is named
    Pn-Report.txt where n is the project number. For example, P1-Report.txt,
    P2-Report.txt, and P3-Report.txt.

    P*-Registers-Script.txt
    -----------------------

    A full config register write script is created for each project file. This
    is the same output that CBProProjectRegistersExport when passed --format
    csv --include-load-writes. This script contains any required control
    register pre- and post-write sequence required to ready the device for
    programming and fully load the configuration when complete.

    For example:

    # Part: Si5345
    # Project File: Si5345-Edited-Project.slabtimeproj
    # Design ID: <none>
    # Includes Pre/Post Download Control Register Writes: Yes
    # Die Revision: B1
    # Creator: CBProMultiProjectExport v2.10.3 [2016-09-13]
    # Created On: 2016-09-13 09:43:18 GMT-05:00
    Address,Data
    0x0B24,0xC0
    0x0B25,0x00
    ...

    P*-Registers-Script.h
    ---------------------

    You can optionally create the same programming script as a C header file.
    Add --c-register-scripts to the command line to generate these.

    P*-Registers-Script-Delta-Only.txt         
    ----------------------------------

    Smaller, delta reconfigure register write script are also created for each
    project file. These scripts contain only the register updates required to
    switch to one of the configurations. USE OF THESE UPDATE SCRIPTS REQUIRES
    THAT ONE OF THE FULL CONFIGURATION WRITE SCRIPTS HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY
    WRITTEN. For example:

       - Device reset
       - Host writes P2-Registers-Script.txt (P2 config loaded)
       - Host writes P3-Registers-Script-Delta-Only.txt (P3 config loaded)
       - Host writes P1-Registers-Script-Delta-Only.txt (P1 config loaded)
       - Host writes P2-Registers-Script-Delta-Only.txt (P2 config loaded)

    The delta update scripts contain any required programming preamble and
    postamble.

    IMPORTANT: if your device contains a configuration pre-programmed by
    Silicon Labs via an Orderable Part Number (OPN) such as Si5345B-B07024-GM
    and you have the project file that was used to create this OPN, you MUST
    STILL WRITE ONE OF THE FULL CONFIGURATION SCRIPTS THIS TOOL GENERATES
    BEFORE USING ONE OF THE UPDATE DELTA SCRIPTS. The version of CBPro you are
    using may generate different registers for the same project file, and
    therefore different delta would be computed.

    P*-Settings.txt
    ---------------

    Per-project named setting (bitfield) export files are also created. This
    is the same information included in Settings.csv, but broken out on a
    per-project basis. This is the same output that CBProProjectSettingsExport
    generates.

    For example:

    # Si538x/4x Settings Export
    # 
    # Part: Si5345
    # Project File: Si5345-Edited-Project.slabtimeproj
    # Design ID: <none>
    # Export Mode: AllNonSpecialUserRegisters
    # Setting Names: Customer
    # Die Revision: B1
    # Creator: CBProMultiProjectExport v2.10.3 [2016-09-13]
    # Created On: 2016-09-13 09:43:18 GMT-05:00
    Location,SettingName,DecimalValue,HexValue
    0x0004[7:0],GRADE,0,0x00
    0x0006[23:0],TOOL_VERSION,0,0x000000
    0x000B[6:0],I2C_ADDR,104,0x68
    0x0016[1],LOL_ON_HOLD,1,0x1
    0x0017[0],SYSINCAL_INTR_MSK,0,0x0
    ...

IN-SYSTEM PROGRAMMING WORKFLOW

    There are many possible workflows given the different types of exports
    produced by this tool. Some of the schemes are described below.

    Use Register Scripts
    --------------------

    Your host software would have a copy of a single full configuration script
    for a base configuration. For example, P2-Registers-Script.txt. It would
    also have a copy of the update register script for each project the host
    may want to switch to, such as P1-Registers-Script-Delta-Only.txt through
    P3-Registers-Script-Delta-Only.txt. On device reset, the host will write
    the P2 full configuration script, P2-Registers-Script.txt. It can then
    write one of the smaller update delta scripts at any time to reconfigure
    the device to P1-P3.

    For example:

       - Device reset
       - Host writes P2-Registers-Script.txt (P2 config loaded)
       - Host writes P3-Registers-Script-Delta-Only.txt (P3 config loaded)
       - Host writes P1-Registers-Script-Delta-Only.txt (P1 config loaded)
       - Host writes P2-Registers-Script-Delta-Only.txt (P2 config loaded)

    Both full and update scripts contain any required control register
    preamble needed to ready the device for programming and postamble required
    to complete programming and load new configuration.

    NOTE: your host must write a full configuration script before using one of
    the update scripts: the update scripts assume that one of
    P1-Registers-Script.txt - P3-Registers-Script.txt was programmed. The host
    does not need to select P1 as the full config base config to program: any
    of the full register script files can be written on device reset.

    Use Registers.csv Only
    ----------------------

    Your host software would have a copy of the Registers.csv data. On device
    boot and reset, the host would:

       - Write any required pre-configuration control register sequence
         to the device
       - Write all registers from one of the configuration columns
       - Write any required post-configuration control register sequence
         to the device

    To switch to a new configuration, the host only need write those registers
    that have Varies=Yes in the change column. The host would be responsible
    for determining whether any additional pre- and post-writes are required
    when switching to a new configuration.

OPTIONS

    --c-register-scripts 

        Create a register script in the form of a C header file for the base
        project and each edit. Text/CSV style register write scripts for each
        project are always created.

    --create-out-folder 

        Create the output folder does not exist already.

    --help 

        Print detailed usage to the console and exit.

    --out-folder folder

        The output folder. If this is not specified, the folder where the tool
        is run is used.

    --project pathname

        The base configuration project file. You are modifying this design.
        The underlying file will never be changed. You must specify this.

    --version 

        Print this program's version number and exit.
