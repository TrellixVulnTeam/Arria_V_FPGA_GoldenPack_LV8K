SYNOPSIS

    CBProProjectSettingsExport [ opts ] --project myproj.slabtimeproj

DESCRIPTION

    This export will contain the named settings (aka bitfields) corresponding
    to yor device configuration. It is provided for review of configuration.
    It is similar to the settings dump included in design reports and
    datasheet addendums.

    For programming in-system, the per-byte register export format should be
    used for simplicity and speed of programming. The register export file may
    also contain any programming preamble/postamble required by the device.

    Please refer to your device's Family Reference Manual for information on
    register addressing and an explanation of the settings.

        timestamp. Specify this argument to exclude the header. Not applicable
