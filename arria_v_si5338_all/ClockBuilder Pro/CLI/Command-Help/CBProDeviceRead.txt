    CBProDeviceRead --help

DESCRIPTION

    Reads device registers and associated named settings (aka bitfields) from
    a supported Silicon Labs Timing evaluation Board (EVB) or ClockBuilder Pro
    Field Programmer (FP). Has three general modes of operation:

    + Read one or more named settings you specify either on the command line
    (--settings option). Reads are done at the register level, but output is
    per-setting.

    + Read one or more registers you specify either on the command line
    (--registers option). In this mode, no mapping to setting names is done:
    you get back a simple register address, value list.

    + Read all read-only and read-write settings on the device (--all option).
    Reads are done at the register level, but output is per-setting.

    By default a text table is created. Comma separated value (CSV), tab
    separated value, and HTML are also supported via the --format option.

    See EXAMPLES for an example of command line usage and output for each
    mode.

    If more than one EVB or FP is connected to your PC, you must use the
    --device option to specify which you are targeting. You pass an identifier
    for the device, which can be listed using the --list-devices option. For
    example, CBProDeviceRead --list-devices might return:

         00-00-16-B1-20-A2 (Si5345 EVB)
         00-00-15-E2-E2-60 (Si5380 EVB)

    You can then pass either 00-00-16-B1-20-A2 or 00-00-15-E2-E2-60 to the
    --device argument. For example:

         CBProDeviceRead --device 00-00-15-E2-E2-60 --all

    The program will exit with status code 0 on success, and 1 on error.

FIELD PROGRAMMER

    You must configure communication settings when using a ClockBuilder Pro
    Field Programmer. The following options are available:

         --family family-id
              Device family. Required if field programmer wired to PCB using
              serial cable. Optional with socket.

         --mode i2c|spi3wire|spi4wire
              Communication mode. See below for when required.

         --io-voltage 1.8|2.5|3.3
              I/O supply voltage. See below for when required.

         --speed 100k|400k|1M|2M|...|12M
              Bus speed. Optional. The fastest speed is selected by default.

         --i2c-address
              I2C address. Required in I2C mode.

    0x0B57[11:0]  R/W   VCO_RESET_CALCODE      270            0x10E

    Reads all read-only and read-write settings from the device. Device
    readings are saved to settings.txt. Uses the default file format, a
    formatted text table.

EXAMPLE - READ ALL DEVICE SETTINGS, OUTPUT CSV

    C:\> CBProDeviceRead --all --quiet --format csv

    Location,Type,SettingName,DecimalValue,HexValue
    0x0000[3:0],R/O,DIE_REV,5,0x5
    0x0002[15:0],R/O,PN_BASE,21317,0x5345

    0x0B57[11:0],R/W,VCO_RESET_CALCODE,270,0x10E

    Reads all read-only and read-write settings from the device. Device
    readings are output to the console in CSV format. Enables quiet mode, so
    that status messages are not displayed on the console.

EXAMPLE - READ SELECT DEVICE SETTINGS, OUTPUT TEXT REPORT

    C:\> CBProDeviceRead.exe --quiet --settings PN_BASE DEVICE_REV

    Location      Type  Setting Name  Decimal Value  Hex Value
    ------------  ----  ------------  -------------  ---------

    0x0005[7:0]   R/O   DEVICE_REV    3              0x03

    Reads two device settings and outputs the results in a text report. Uses
    quiet mode to skip status messages.

EXAMPLE - READ SELECT DEVICE REGISTERS, OUTPUT TEXT REPORT

    C:\> CBProDeviceRead.exe --quiet --registers 0x0002 0x0003 0x0005

    Address  Decimal Value  Hex Value

    0x0003   83             0x53
    0x0005   3              0x03

    Reads three registers from the device. The registers read are the
    underlying registers for PN_BASE and DEVICE_REV in the previous example.
    Uses quiet mode to skip status messages.

EXAMPLE - READ ALL DEVICE SETTINGS FROM Si5345 DEVICE ON PCB USING FIELD
PROGRAMMER

    C:\> CBProDeviceRead --family si538x4x --mode i2c --i2c-address 0x6c
    --io-voltage 3.3 --speed 400k --all --outfile state.txt

    Searching for EVBs/FPs ...
    Reading from device ...
    Saving to state.txt ...

    Reads all settings from device connected to the field programmer using an
    I2C serial connection. The device is at 7-bit address 0x6c. A 3.3V I/O
    supply voltage is used, and the I2C bus is driven at 400 kpbs. The
    settings are saved to a text file, state.txt.

EXAMPLE - READ ALL DEVICE SETTINGS FROM SI5332 DEVICE ON PCB USING FIELD
PROGRAMMER

    C:\> CBProDeviceRead --family si5332 --i2c-address 0x6a --speed 400k --all
    --outfile state.txt

    Searching for EVBs/FPs ...
    Reading from device ...
    Saving to state.txt ...

    Reads all settings from Si5332 device connected to the field programmer
    using an I2C serial connection. The device is at 7-bit address 0x6a. I/O
    supply voltage is auto set to 3.3V for this device. The I2C bus is driven
    at 400 kpbs. The settings are saved to a text file, state.txt.

OPTIONS

    --all 

        Read all read-only and read-write registers from the device. The
        output is setting oriented.

    --device id

        Select the Evaluation Board or Field Programmer to target. Required if
        there are 2 or more EVBs/FPs attached to the PC.

    --family family-id

        A device family that is being targeted. See FIELD PROGRAMMER section.

    --format text|csv|tab|html

        Output format. The default is a text table.

    --help 

        Print detailed usage to the console and exit.

    --i2c-address addr

        7-bit I2C address when using the ClockBuilder Pro field programmer in
        I2C mode. There is no default. You can specify the address in 0xNN hex
        format or NN decimal.

    --io-voltage 1.8|2.5|3.3

        I/O voltage when using the ClockBuilder Pro field programmer. See
        FIELD PROGRAMMER section.

    --list-devices 

        List Silicon Labs Timing devices -- Evaluation Boards and Field
        Programmers -- connected to the PC and exit.

    --mode i2c|spi3wire|spi4wire

        Communication mode when using the ClockBuilder Pro field programmer.
        See FIELD PROGRAMMER section.

    --noscan-in-fp-registers-mode 

        Communication with the device using the field programmer is normally
        verified before an operation by reading fixed identification
        register(s) such as PN_BASE on Si538x/4x. Specifying this option will
        disable this behavior when --registers mode is used.

    --outfile pathname

        File to save results to. If not specified, device read results are
        displayed on standard output.

    --quiet 

        Enable quiet mode. Normally status messages are printed to standard
        error. You can disable these using this option.

    --registers 

        Read one or more registers from the device. Registers to dump are must
        be specified on the command line. Use 0x hex format, such as 0x000C.

    --settings 

        Read one or more named settings (aka bitfields) from the device.
        Settings to dump are must be specified on the command line.

    --speed 100k|400k|1M|2M|...|12M

        I2C or SPI bus speed when using the ClockBuilder Pro field programmer.
        The default is 400 kHz in I2C mode and 12 MHz in SPI mode.

    --version 

        Print this program's version number and exit.
