    CBProProjectRegistersExport

SYNOPSIS

    CBProProjectRegistersExport [ opts ] --format csv|cheader 
                               --project myproj.slabtimeproj 
                               --outfile export.txt

    CBProProjectRegistersExport --help

DESCRIPTION

    Exports the sequence of registers that must be written to achieve the
    design/configuration present in the specified project file. Two formats
    are supported:

    + CSV: each line in the file is an address,data pair in hexadecimal
    format. A comma separates the address and data fields. By default, a
    #-style header is included at the top of the file.
    + "C" Code Header: the register write sequence is expressed in C code via
    an array of address,data pairs. This can be used directly in firmware
    code.

    You specify which format to export using the --format options. There is no
    default: you must select a format.

    Please refer to your device's Family Reference Manual for information on
    register addressing and how to write the data contained within this
    export.

OPTIONS

    --format csv|cheader

        The export format. You must specify this.

    --help 

        Print detailed usage to the console and exit.

    --include-load-writes 

        Certain control registers must be written before and after writing the
        volatile configuration registers. This ensures the device is stable
        during configuration download and resumes normal operation after the
        download is complete. If you want to include these special pre- and
        post-write register writes in the export, specify this option.

        Not supported by all devices. If your target device does not use this
        option, a warning message will be printed if --include-load-writes is
        supplied on the command line. In this case, the output will be the
        same regardless.

    --no-header 

        Normally, a summary header will be included in the export. Each line
        in the header will be prefixed by the # character. The header will
        contain some basic information about the design, tool, and a
        timestamp. Specify this argument to exclude the header. Not applicable
        in CBProProjectRegistersExport "C" code mode.

    --outfile pathname

        The file to save the export data to. If this file already exists, it
        will be overwritten. You must specify this.

    --project pathname

        The project file to export. You must specify this.

    --version 

        Print this program's version number and exit.
