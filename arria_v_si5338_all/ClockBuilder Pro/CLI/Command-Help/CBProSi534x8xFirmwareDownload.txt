DESCRIPTION

    Writes a firmware file to a supported Silicon Labs device. Supports device
    being in program mode or already in bootloader mode. Firmware write is
    verified.

    The following firmware formats are supported:

    + Boot Record: a firmware image packed into a boot record that is
    compatible with the device's bootloader. Use the --bootrecord-file option
    to specify this type of firmware image.
    + Stand-Alone: a firmware image normally used with Silicon Labs MCU
    development tools and debug adapter. CBPro will convert this type of file
    to the boot record file automatically. Use the --standalone-file option to
    specify this type of firmware image

    Supports the following types of targets:

    + The device is on a Silicon Labs Evaluation Board (EVB)
    + The device is on a 3rd party board and connected to a Silicon Labs
    ClockBuilder Field Programmer (FP) via wired serial connection
    + The device is in a supported socket connected to the Silicon Labs
    ClockBuilder Field Programmer (FP)

    If more than one EVB or FP is connected to your PC, you must use the
    --device option to specify which you are targeting. You pass an identifier
    for the device, which can be listed using the --list-devices option. For
    example, CBProSi534x8xFirmwareDownload --list-devices might return:

         00-00-16-B1-20-A2 (Si5383 EVB)
         00-00-15-E2-E2-60 (Si5380 EVB)

    You can then pass either 00-00-16-B1-20-A2 or 00-00-15-E2-E2-60 to the
    --device argument. For example:

         CBProSi534x8xFirmwareDownload --device 00-00-15-E2-E2-60
                                       --bootrecord-file si5383.bin

    Status messages are displayed to the console as the download progresses.
    The program will exit with status code 0 on success, and 1 on error.

FIELD PROGRAMMER

    You must configure communication settings when using a ClockBuilder Pro
    Field Programmer. The following options are available:

         --i2c-address
              I2C address. Required.

         --speed 100k|400k
              Bus speed. Optional. 400 kHz is selected by default.

EXAMPLES

    CBProSi534x8xFirmwareDownload.exe --i2c-address 0x6c --bootrecord-file
    sibrecord.bin

        Downloads a bootrecord-based firmware image using the ClockBuilder Pro
        Field Programmer. Sets I2C bus speed to 400 kHz (the default). The
        device must be configured for address 0x6C. The device can be in
        program mode or already in bootloader mode.

    CBProSi534x8xFirmwareDownload.exe --standalone-file sifw.hex

        Downloads a stand-alone firmware image to a Silicon Labs Evaluation
        Board. The file swfw.hex is converted internally to bootrecord format.
        The device on the EVB can be in program mode or already in bootloader
        mode.

OPTIONS

    --bootrecord-file pathname

        A bootrecord-based firmware file to program on the device. Can be a
        .hex or .bin file.

    --device id

        Select the Evaluation Board or Field Programmer to target. Required if
        there are 2 or more EVBs/FPs attached to the PC.

    --help 

        Print detailed usage to the console and exit.

    --i2c-address addr

        7-bit I2C address when using the ClockBuilder Pro field programmer.
        There is no default. You can specify the address in 0xNN hex format or
        NN decimal.

    --list-devices 

        List Silicon Labs Timing devices -- Evaluation Boards and Field
        Programmers -- connected to the PC and exit.

    --speed 100k|400k

        I2C bus speed when using the ClockBuilder Pro field programmer. The
        default is 400 kHz.

    --standalone-file pathname

        A standard firmware image that is normally downloaded using a Silicon
        Labs USB Debug Adapter. This tool will convert it to a the boot record
        format and flash using the device's bootloader. Can be a .hex or .bin
        file.

    --version 

        Print this program's version number and exit.
